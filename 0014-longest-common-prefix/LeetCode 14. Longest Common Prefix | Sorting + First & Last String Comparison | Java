LeetCode 14. Longest Common Prefix | Sorting + First & Last String Comparison

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/solutions/7178701/leetcode-14-longest-common-prefix-sorting-first-last-string-comparison/

Intuition
The common prefix of all strings must also be the prefix between the lexicographically smallest and largest string in the array.
Lexicographically means dictionary order or alphabetical order, like how words are arranged in a dictionary.Strings are compared character by character using their Unicode values (for English letters, that’s basically a < b < c < … < z).
So, instead of comparing every string, we can just compare the first and last after sorting.

Approach

1. Sort the array of strings in lexicographical order.
2. Take the first string (str1) and the last string (str2).
3. Compare them character by character until a mismatch is found or one string ends.
4. The common prefix is str1.substring(0, index).
5. If no characters match, return an empty string.

Complexity

Time complexity:    Sorting takes O(N log N), where N is the number of strings.
Space complexity:   Sorting is in-place and only a few extra variables are used. O(1)
